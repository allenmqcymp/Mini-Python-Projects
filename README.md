# Mini Python Projects

## About

A repo containing small-medium Python projects that don't deserve their own repo

## Game of Life

A simple Tkinter simulation of Conway's game of life.
Left click to set active cells; right click to run simulation.
Requires Python 2.x, run using ```python GameOfLife.py```

## Blackjack Simulation

A simple Monte-Carlo blackjack simulation. 
The program runs 1000 blackjack games between a dealer and a player. 
Cards are randomly shuffled.
Aces are treated by each party as a 11 by default; if the player/dealer's hand goes bust with Ace as 11, then the
Ace becomes a 1

## Google Dinosaur Game

A very buggy but functional version of Google's offline dinosaur game.
Does not include birds and night mode; does not increase in speed as score goes up.
Requires Pygame and runs on Python 2.x
This was made quite a long time ago and the code is very amateur.
To run: ```python GoogleDinoGameClass.py```
